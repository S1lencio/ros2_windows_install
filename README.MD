## WIP Python install script for ROS2 Jazzy

Installs ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco by following the installation workflow found [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html).

This script is a work in progress and does not work yet. It will only run on Windows 10 or 11.

Current status:
- Visual Studio does not install correctly
- Installation fails at py7zr installation due to Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater missing

Anything beyond py7zr is not yet tested.
