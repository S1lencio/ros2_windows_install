## WIP Python install script for ROS2 Jazzy

Installs ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco by following the installation workflow found [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html).

This script is a work in progress and does not work yet. It will only run on Windows 10 or 11.
#

#### Current status:
Installation succeeds, but the FastDDS implementation fails to run, causing any ROS2 commands to fail.
